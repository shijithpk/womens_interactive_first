This is a repository of the code, data and images for a women's day interactive on the Indian news website [wionews.com](http://www.wionews.com)

**Notes**
* The image on the interactive homepage is taken from the [wikimedia commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Female_shadow_anatomy_without_labels.svg).
* The data for the interactive is taken from the [Medical Certification of Causes of Death report 2014](www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-Documents/mccd_Report1/mccd_report_2014.pdf).
* The colour combinations chosen for the different pages are from the Visme.co [blog](http://blog.visme.co/color-combinations/)
* I chose not to do a slide on deaths caused by perinatal conditions, which, if you look at slide 2, is actually the fourth biggest cause of deaths among Indian women. The thing is that most of the deaths occur in girls under the age of one, and doesn't really affect other age groups, so there isn't really anything interesting to say about it.
* Also, if anyone is offended by this interactive, I want to apologise in advance. It isn't my aim to trivialise death and I am aware of the ethical issues involved in visualising it. Hope I'm coming out on the right side of things here.
